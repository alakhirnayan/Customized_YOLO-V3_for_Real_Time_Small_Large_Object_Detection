Check the detected image into "det" directory and also check the orginal images of "det" directory from "imgs" directory.

You will see a clock in det directoy which is very small, but this model can identify it. besides it can detect traffic lights, car standing very far and also a small dog. 

I will upload a full guideline in here when all my work will be finished. 

I have hybridized it from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet 
you can see the mother code from the link. but my codes are different. I have mixed ResNet with it.
and also some other logics.

Thnx for visiting my repository.
